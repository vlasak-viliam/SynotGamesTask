# SynotGamesTask
Assignment for Synot Games job inteview

Welcome!
Hope this doesn't take you too long :)

Whole repository can be pulled at once, as I used Playwright for all 3 tasks. More detailed guide can be found in the section below.

Repository contains 3 tasks:
1. UI Automation - Perform a Google Search for the term "synot games".
Covered in "bingsearch" folder - https://github.com/vlasak-viliam/SynotGamesTask/tree/master/Synot/bingsearch
Initially, I started with google search, but I couldn't get past CAPTCHA. Some code can be found in - https://github.com/vlasak-viliam/SynotGamesTask/blob/master/Synot/obsolete/google.spec.ts

2. API Automation For Dog CEO API - verify:
A successful response (200 OK) from the https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random endpoint.
The response contains a valid image URL
My solution can be found here - https://github.com/vlasak-viliam/SynotGamesTask/tree/master/Synot/dogCEO

3. For Free Public APIs, choose one API from the list and:
Make a GET request to an endpoint. Validate the structure and content of the response.

I chose the dog facts endpoint (https://dogapi.dog/api/v2/facts) of https://dogapi.dog/docs/api-v2 
The solution can be found here - https://github.com/vlasak-viliam/SynotGamesTask/tree/master/Synot/dogFacts
